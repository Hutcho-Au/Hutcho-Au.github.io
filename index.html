<h1>My journey from being a tradie to becomming a programmer</h1>

<div id="start-of-journey"><h2>The start of my journey</h2>

<p>I started to learn coding languages on a phone app named SoloLearn. <br>
I learned a fair bit of Python3, HTML, and JavaScript.<br>
SoloLearn is a bit like read, type, read, type, read type.... with no real results, or ways yo make the infomation to stick.</p></div>

<div id="where-i-started"><h2>Where I started</h2>

<p>I started learning coding before I had even contemplated changing careers.<br> 
I think it stemmed from when I was a kid and I was facinated with windows dot prompt. I was playing around with command lines back then in the early 90s and I could see more than the basic interface that we use on windows now.</p></div>

<p id="not-fun">"I began coding on the SoloLearn App. This wasn't a fun way of learning to code."</p>



<p> I then found out from my brothers neighbor about <a href="https://www.khanacademy.org/">Khan Academy</a>, which is the platform he used to learn coding. My brothers neighbor is now an expert at coding, despite being really yong. He's still on his P-plates and he looks a bit like Troye Sivan.
<br>I have learned so much on Khan Academy. Every part of this website I have coded from scratch, using the skills I have learned.</p>

<div id= "image"><img src = "https://www.simplilearn.com/ice9/free_resources_article_thumb/Best-Programming-Languages-to-Start-Learning-Today.jpg"></div>

<h4>Some of what I have learned about coding</h4>
<div id="coding-list"><ul>
    <li> HTML & CSS. <span id="including">(including)</span></li>
    <li> Lists like this, and ordered lists.
    <li> Fonts, and how to style them.
    <li> How to do borders, padding, and margins.
    <li> How to use Hyper references (href).
    <li> JavaScript, such as;
    <li> Objects, Loops, arrays, and functions.
    <li> Drawing shapes with code.
    <li> Animation basics.
    <li> Creating functional buttons.
    <li> and much more.
</ul></div>

<h3>As I learn and get more creative, so will this website</h3>
